# Woof
### Remaking Twitter
This is the repository for my Woof project. This project aims to recreate a more privacy-centered Twitter.

To achieve this, I broke up the project into two steps.

1. Create the UI and website using Jeckyll
2. After finishing up the UI, I will them move the code to Amazon Web Services, using Python and Flask to deploy the website.
3. I will then create a database to store the user data and Barks
4. Finally, I will tie everything together
